Dotfiles
========

My dotfiles.

Install
-------
I use [bashdot](https://github.com/bashdot/bashdot) to manage all my config files.

Warning: Make sure to create a backup of your existing files, or remove things you don't need. `bashdot` creates symlinks of all config files and might delete existing files.

```bash
git clone --recursive https://github.com/rottencandy/dotfiles
bashdot install dotfiles
```
